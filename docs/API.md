# API Docs

## API Style

The control plane is a NestJS API. All tenant-scoped routes require authenticated organization membership. Public telephony webhooks require provider signature verification and idempotency keys.

## Modules

- Auth: Better Auth integration, sessions, invitations, roles.
- Organizations: tenants, memberships, permissions.
- Agents: roles, prompts, language policies, model defaults.
- Workflows: draft graphs, validation, publishing, manifest preview.
- Runtime: manifest compilation, sandbox start, runtime events.
- Telephony: connections, numbers, webhooks, dispatch, health checks.
- Integrations: OAuth connections, connector health, tool grants.
- Memory: records, retrieval, approval, retention, deletion.
- Calls: sessions, transcripts, recordings, summaries, dispositions.
- Monitoring: live event stream, escalation queue, quality flags.
- Billing: usage events, budgets, plan limits, cost estimates.
- Audit: immutable security and admin activity records.

## Representative Routes

- POST /organizations/:orgId/workflows/:workflowId/validate
- POST /organizations/:orgId/workflows/:workflowId/publish
- GET /organizations/:orgId/workflows/:workflowId/manifest-preview
- POST /organizations/:orgId/sandbox/calls
- POST /organizations/:orgId/telephony/connections
- POST /organizations/:orgId/telephony/connections/:id/validate
- POST /organizations/:orgId/integrations/:provider/connect
- GET /integrations/oauth/:provider/callback
- GET /organizations/:orgId/memory
- PATCH /organizations/:orgId/memory/:memoryId
- DELETE /organizations/:orgId/memory/:memoryId
- GET /organizations/:orgId/calls/:callId/events
- POST /telephony/webhooks/:provider

## Contract Rules

- APIs never return raw secrets.
- Tenant ID is always derived from authenticated membership or verified telephony route, not trusted from arbitrary payloads.
- Mutations write audit logs.
- Runtime event writes are idempotent.
- Published versions are immutable.
